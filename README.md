- **Performance Analytics** – Automated win-rate, profit factor, drawdown, and expectancy calculations with interactive Plotly visualizations.
- **Trade Import Pipeline** – Upload CSV/XLSX exports, parse instantly, and review risk metrics by pair, timeframe, or strategy tag.
- **Journaling & Tagging** – Add notes, labels, and exportable PDF/Excel reports to track psychology and behavior over time.
- **Usage & Plan Controls** – Tier-based limits (Free, Pro, Plus, Elite) with transparent quota tracking for chat, uploads, and history depth.
- **Offline & Reliability Features** – Client-side queueing, error boundaries, toast notifications, and retry logic keep the experience resilient.

## 📋 Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+
- `pnpm` (preferred) or npm
- Supabase project with a Postgres database
- OpenAI (or XAI) API key for AI features
- Optional: Stripe/Flutterwave credentials for billing, Sentry/PostHog keys for monitoring

## ⚙️ Getting Started
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Abdulmuiz44/Tradia.git
cd Tradia
pnpm install
cp .env.example .env.local
```

Populate `.env.local` using the template below:

```env
# Supabase Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_supabase_service_role_key

# OpenAI / XAI Configuration
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
XAI_API_KEY=your_xai_api_key

# App Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=http://localhost:3000
NODE_ENV=development
NEXT_PUBLIC_ADMIN_EMAIL=founder@example.com
```

### Supabase Bootstrapping
1. Create a project at [supabase.com](https://supabase.com) and copy the project URL plus service keys.
2. In the SQL editor run the statements from `supabase-minimal.sql` to create tables, buckets, and enums.
3. Apply Row Level Security using `create-policies.sql`. If execution fails in bulk, run the provided SQL chunks or configure policies manually via **Authentication › Policies**.
4. Confirm the `chat-uploads` storage bucket exists (create it manually if not).

### Development Workflow
```bash
pnpm run dev
```
Visit `http://localhost:3000` once the dev server reports ready.

## 🧰 Project Scripts
```bash
pnpm run dev           # Start the Next.js dev server
pnpm run build         # Production build
pnpm run start         # Serve built app
pnpm run lint          # ESLint checks
pnpm run type-check    # TypeScript project refs
pnpm run test          # Jest unit tests (add coverage as the suite grows)
pnpm run test:e2e      # Playwright end-to-end suite
pnpm run analyze       # Bundle analysis report (ANALYZE=true)
```

Payments are processed through Flutterwave; upgrade flows are embedded directly in-app.

## 🔒 Security & Compliance
- Supabase storage with encryption at rest, HTTPS for all data transfer.
- JWT-based auth via Supabase with tier-aware RLS policies.
- Sentry and PostHog integrations for diagnostics (ensure consent banners for production).
- Regularly audit third-party dependencies and rotate API keys.

## 🧪 Quality & Monitoring
- ESLint + TypeScript ensure consistency; run `pnpm run lint && pnpm run type-check` before commits.
- Jest/Playwright harnesses exist—add coverage for core analytics, chat flows, and plan gating.
- Consider enabling GitHub Actions (see `.github/workflows`) for automated checks on each PR.
- Vercel recommended for hosting; monitor Core Web Vitals and error rates post-deployment.

## 🛠 Troubleshooting Tips
- Dev server port conflicts: ensure no other Next.js instance is bound to `127.0.0.1:3000`.
- Supabase policy errors: verify RLS policies align with `auth.uid()` usage shown in the SQL scripts.
- AI provider limits: set fallback providers in the env file if you toggle between OpenAI and XAI.
- For Windows developers, use the provided PowerShell scripts for deployment (`deploy-vercel.ps1`).

## 🤝 Contributing
